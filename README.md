# repo-manipulator

repo-manipulator manipulates data in a NAS repository using commands.

You can exit app using `exit` command.

# commands
```
ls systems # list system names in /systems/ decoding base32
add systems sys3 # create a file with the system name in /systems/ encoding base32
cat systems sys4 # print contents finding the maching file by name
cat systems sys3 --jtable # show the contents finding the maching file by name, and open it with jtable gui.
get systems sys3 # get the contents finding the maching file by name, save it in downloads, then open it with the editor written below (mousepad).
get systems sys3 --jtable # get the contents finding the maching file by name, save it in downloaads, then open it with jtable gui.
clear systems sys3 # like `get` command this opens the editor but with the empty system document.
len systems sys3 # prints "%d" that is the length of the non-empty records contained in this system document.
diff systems sys3 # compares the objects in the latest version in the repository with those of the previous one and shows difference in json having "deleted" and "added".
push systems sys3 # reads the contents after finding the file in downloads, then write it in the file in the repository.

ls schedules # list schedule names in /schedules/ decoding base32
add schedules sc1 # create a file with the schedule name in /schedules/ encoding base32
cat schedules sc4 # print contents finding the maching file by name
get schedules sc3 # get the contents finding the maching file by name, save it in downloads, then open it with the editor written below (mousepad).
clear schedules sc3 # like `get` command this opens the editor but with the empty schedule document.
len schedules sc3 # prints "%d" that is how many dates contained in this schedule document.
diff schedules sys3 # compares the dates in the latest version in the repository with those of the previous one and shows difference in json having "deleted" and "added".
push schedules sc3 # reads the contents after finding the file in downloads, then write it in the file in the repository

ls contacts # list contact names in /contacts/ decoding base32
add contacts cont1 # create a file with the contact name in /contacts/ encoding base32
cat contacts cont4 # print contents finding the maching file by name
get contacts cont3 # get the contents finding the maching file by name, save it in downloads, then open it with the editor written below (mousepad).
clear contacts c3 # like `get` command this opens the editor but with the empty contact document.
len contacts c3 # prints "%d" that is how many contacts contained in this contact document.
diff contacts c3 # compares the phone numbers in the latest version in the repository with those of the previous one and shows difference in json having "deleted" and "added".
push contact c3 # reads the contents after finding the file in downloads, then write it in the file in the repository

export systems foo.csv # export data in systems to the csv and open with the editor.
